        <h3>Brand</h3>
        <p>Branding and design agency specializing for small businesses.  Cluttered, wordy, confused. My first impression when I landed on this site was "whoa".  I knew that they were a branding agency that helps promote small businesses, but after seeing that feature area, I was overwhelmed by the small and the amount of text on the page.  It seems like they are trying to fit too much above the fold instead of using it to pitch their brand.</p>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>The user can easily understand what they do and can click the pictures on the 4 column layout to see additional details.  It highlights their recent work so the user has to navigate to another page to see their past work.  They show off their blog, Twitter feed and a book list to attempt to keep personal relations with the users.</p>
        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>This site has a Twitter feed as well and keeps in touch with the user by posting their latest blog entry on the site.  Clicking on the pictures on the homepage will cause some sort of box shadow that makes it seem like the user is actually clicking something like a button.  They also change the color of their header background depending on the page you are currently on.</p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>Personally, I am not a big fan of expanding all the elements of navigation on the header.  It adds a layer of complexity that is unnecessary if your site is easily navigable.  They should cut it down to just "Services", "Work" and "About us" and interact with user within those pages.  By putting all the navigation elements in the header, you lose that sense of interactivity.  However, one positive side to this is that all the sites internal links are listed and a user could potentially navigate the whole site (if they wanted to).</p>
