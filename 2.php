        <h3>Brand</h3>
        <p>This is another example of a branding and design agency.  Right amount of color, simplistic, great typography.  They use a grey theme to offset the content from the backgroun.  They have a very simple logo with a purple background, which can also be seen in their "Home" navigation button.</p>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>The site has a feature area highlighting their clients and below, there is a 4 column layout showing off their "Latest Buzz". If the user scrolls down, they will see a search bar that can help you navigate through the site. There aren't any striking functionality problems, but it would be more helpful if the site showed off their work in the first page as opposed to their "Latest Buzz".</p>
        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>When the user lands on the homepage, they have a gallery slider that is automatically shifting.  It can also be manually clicked.  They place their "Click to see more work" under each of these pictures, which I think is a usability error becaue the automatic shifting gallery might cause a user to misclick on the client they want to see.  They have a good list of work that is separated by categories, which makes it easier for the user to find what they are looking for.</p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>Navigation is not a problem. A user can definitely find what they are looking for - "Buzz", "Our Work", "Us", "Media".  However, a user must go to "Us" to find out contact information about the company. This is seemingly a small problem, but in reality, it might cause the company to lose a lot of users.  It's not intuitive at first and even after clicking "Us", the user might not be able to see the faint grey "Contact" that blends in with the background.
