        <h3>Brand</h3>
        <p>Graphic designer. Unique, graphic, simple. I would use unique to sum up this page in one word.  The backdrop has an individual (probably the designer himself) holding up a long piece of white paper with all his information on it.  It's unique and definitely different from the common and standard layouts that I have seen.</p>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>Clicking on any of the navigation links will scroll the page down to the next fold.  This is another single page layout.  The user is easily able to see the content that they want to view.  Personally, I think the "back" button is one of the most used features on the browser and users should technically be able to "back" up to their previous functions.</p>
        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>The page will scroll when a navigation link is clicked.  When a piece of his work is clicked, it will load up a modal window that the user can cycle through like a gallery.  The main page is still scrollable within the modal window, which I believe should be a usability issue.  When hovering over the link, the user will see caption text that describes the work.</p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>The navigation links aren't in the standard header of the page.  It is in the middle of the page, but it is easily visible in the highly contrasted black background.</p>
