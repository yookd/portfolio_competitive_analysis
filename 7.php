        <h3>Brand</h3>
        <p>On first glance, confused. I don't know what they do immediately off the bat.  All I see is "Monkey Business" and I don't know if I'm willing to hire monkey business.  They show off their news, profile and services, but I can't seem to see any of their work immediately when I land on the site.  I see a drawing, but I am unsure if it is theirs.  Their entire site is above the fold.</p>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>There are too many navigation links.  There are a total of 9 in a line.  That's a lot of navigating, and some of those can definitely be put into subcategories within the navigation links.  The page is above the fold so the user does not have to scroll at all, but because of this, I feel like it is lacking content.  They are simply trying to do too much with their small font.</p>
        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>They have a scrolling news area that automatically highlights their recent news.  It is really annoying.  Every 2 seconds, it scrolls to the next.  It only shows a total of 3 recent news.  If the user wanted to see the news, the user will definitely click it on their own.  In the list of clients under "Clients", there are no available links to their work for each client.  It's simply a static list.  They have recent work on the left, but what if the user wants to see some of the other client work?  It seems like they're hiding information.</p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>Navigation is too verbose.  It needs to be shortened to a few links that go straight to the point.  Some of these links can be put into subcategories.</p>
