        <h3>Brand</h3>
        <p>Right off the bat, it's simplistic with the 3 column layout above the fold. We can tell this is a branding/design or marketing agency for some major companies. Professional, simplistic, to the point.
        </p>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>It definitely shows off what it needs to show.  Above the fold, we have the clients and by clicking the images, the user can navigate to a more detailed page.  The navigation links are clear and concise - the user will easily be able to find what he wants without having to navigate through the site too much.</p>
        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>There are some small interactive elements on the screen.  When the user hovers over the image, it will display a title text that shows you the name of the client. As you scroll down, the company will divulge more information about what they do.  They even have a live Twitter feed to display what they're currently working on or what interests them at the moment.</p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>Navigation does not seem to be a problem as it is very straightforward.  The links are "Work", "Blog", "Company", "Services" and "Contact" - these are standard links and the user can definitely find out all they need to without clicking through multiple links.</p>
