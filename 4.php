        <h3>Brand</h3>
        <p>International brand and design agency. Simple, interactive, powerful. I love their logo - it's an egg, which perfectly matches with the name of their company.They include "Design & web" as part of their brand name, which makes it easier for the user to figure out what kind of company their are. This is a foreign site, but even then, I was able to figure out what they specialize in.</p>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>Again, it follows the 4 column layout with a big feature overlay to show off their work.  The site is simple - they show off their recent work and have a fixed header with navigation links clearly telling the user where to go to find more information about a specific area. When in the summary of their work, the user will see big images of how the site looks like along with a link and a small description of what they worked on.</p>
        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>The homepage is pretty interactive.  It has an automatically sliding feature area that shows off their work and some sort of invitation to an event.  When a user clicks on a certain image, the timer actually gets elongated and pauses it on the image for a while.  After a certain time, it will revert back to its original scrolling speed. The user can also go to a specific page on the slider by clicking one of the circular buttons on the bottom left.  I wish they showed the full images of their recent work above the fold instead of showing only half. Clicking on "Portfolio" will cause their work to cascade upwards. Pretty neat.  Hovering over an image causes it to kind of grey out the image, which tells you the specific element you are looking at.</p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>Much like some of the other sites, this page has clearly defined navigation links.  Even though the page is in French, you can definitely navigate through the site and potentially contact them because the navigation links are in English.</p>
