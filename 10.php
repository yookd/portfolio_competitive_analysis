        <h3>Brand</h3>
        <p>Graphic designer.  Simplistic, orderly, shows off personality.  When I see the page, I can instanly tell what the designer enjoys doing, what his name is and what kind of person he is.  The navigation links are centered on the page and is actually the main feature.  The name of the links are different from that of standard websites.  The page is in a 3 column layout.</p>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>The user can clearly navigate to where he wants to.  The navigation links are split up into "The Work", "The Play", "The Who", "The Talk".  Even though these links need a bit of deciphering, it is unique and strays away from the standard "Home", "About", "Contact".  There is a bright yellow button that will immediately link to the users email.</p>
        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>Hovering over the navigation links will render some sort of design on the background of the page.  This background differs each time depending on which link you are currently hovered over.  When inside the links, the user switches the layout into a fixed sidebar layout and shows off all of his work.  Very organized and great use of space.</p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>The navigation links on the homepage are the central features.  When in a subpage, the links are fixed on the left.  The title of the links remain the same.  Like previously mentioned, the title of the links are very unique to the user and character is what a portfolio is supposed to convey.</p>
