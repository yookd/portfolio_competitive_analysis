        <h3>Brand</h3>
        <p>Design for websites. Interactive, colorful, faulty.  The site itself is colorful.  There are moving pieces on the page that make it seem like the page is alive. When I loaded the page on a specific instance, the page actually broke and threw some javascript errors.  I can't seem to duplicate the error, but one chance is all a website has.</p>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>The site is pretty straight forward.  The user lands onto the "home" area of the page with navigation links on the top.  When the user clicks a navigation link, he is directed to either the space above the island or below the water.  Click the navigation links to see what this specifically means.  I dislike how the site goes up and down for each navigation link.  In a way, it causes confusion and even might cause dizziness for some.</p>
        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>Like previously mentioned, the page is interactive.  The "home" area has flying birds and clicking on the links will scroll the page up and down.  The page is perfectly placed in the fold and each navigation element will go to another fold.  However, when a user tries to manually scroll when the page is scrolling automatically, it glitches and fails to navigate the user to the top.</p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>Clicking on the navigation links will cause the page to scroll up and down.  The links themselves are clearly defined and the user can find what he wants immediately.</p>
