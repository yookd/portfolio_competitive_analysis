        <h3>Brand</h3>
        <p>Graphic design and tutorial site. Immediately, I am able to find out what they specialize in because of their brand name. They have a feature area highlighting their work with a caption for each image that displays what it is, who the work was done by and even a small welcome message.  Simple and clean.  The website is very minimalistic with barely any text and big images.  The design is very straight to the point.</p>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>The sliding gallery is somewhat slow and there are only 2 images.  I feel like this is unnecessary unless you are showing off around 5 images to actually go through.  Under the feature image, it seems like they put their blog posts where users can view comments and read more about it.  I would have liked to have seen their portfolio work rather than blog posts.</p>
        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>The feature area in the middle automatically slides to the next image. Other than that, there is no real interactivity within the site.  Many blocks of static text and images.</p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>The navigation links span the top header of the page above the logo.  They are intuitive - however, clicking on "T-Shirt Shop" will actually directyou to another page that is not in the site.  They should put the store within their main site to maintain consistency.</p>
